### About Me!
I was born on **February 11th, 2007**.  

My journey with computers began when I was **6 years old**, on my mom's Windows XP laptop. From that moment, I was hooked—not on coding yet, but on the idea that **we as humans created such amazing technology**. The ability to **access information and do so much with just a few clicks** fascinated me.  

My brother, an IT graduate, inspired me to **give coding a try**. The fact that you can **work from anywhere, at any time** sounded like an amazing opportunity.  

I’m deeply curious about **technology**, how it works on the inside, and the different types of systems and contraptions that make our modern world possible. 🖥️💡🔧

> ⚠️ Currently a student, so don’t expect my contributions to be constant—unless I manage to avoid getting side-tracked 😅
